## How to run:

Click run button in IDE (typically a play button already located on screen, or through the Run tab at the top)
Enter file location, (example: /home/syed0053/CSCI5801/repo-Team20/Project1/misc/CPL_Election.csv)
If the election is an Instant Runoff election, enter , otherwise enter for Closed Party Listing
Election will run and automatically process the associated algorithm as well as creating the Audit and Media file
The newly created files should be viewable in the same directory as the SRS, SDD, etc.


## Notes:
This program uses today's date for elections as dates are not provided in the input file
This program also doesn't include candidates in the CPL election as they are also not in the input file
Both Audit and Media files will be generated on the home direcotry of the project
The Javadoc generated by our IDE was very convoluted
Many class object have extra constructors because we wanted to be flexible with what information we would recieve to parse for our Election CSV files
